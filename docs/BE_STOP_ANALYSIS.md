# BE-Stop failure review (TSLA 5m, Adaptive TP + Reversal)

Question from the desk: *BE-Stop exits show ~$0 — that's not a real exit. What's the proper
failure amount, and can we avoid them or take an alternative trade on those days?*

Tools: `scripts/analyze_be_stops.py --run N` and `scripts/compare_variants.py --run N`.
Every trade now stores `risk_amount` = `|entry − base SL| × qty` in the DB.

## 1. What a BE-Stop actually costs

A "BE Stop" means BE-Retrace had already moved the stop to entry, then price came back and
hit it. With realistic slippage it books ~**−$0.02/unit** — essentially free. That number is
*correct*: the protection worked. What was misleading was calling it a $0 **win**; it is a
**failure** (the trade never made money) but a **cheap** one.

The honest dollar view (2026 YTD, 68 BE-Stops):

| Measure | Value |
|--------|------|
| P&L actually booked on the 68 | **+$0.25 total** (slippage only) |
| Risk that was on the table (base-SL) | **avg $7.25/trade · max $19.94** |
| Total risk BE-Retrace neutralised | **≈ $493** |

So BE-Retrace converted ~$493 of potential drawdown into a $0.25 scratch. The "proper failure
amount" per trade is now stored as `risk_amount` — the loss you'd have taken **without** BE.

## 2. Why they happen — two distinct causes

Reconstructing each day (MFE/MAE after entry, EOD close):

- **Premature BE (whipsaw-then-resume)** — on ~18/68 the original direction would have been
  *profitable* if held (`hold_eod > 0`), but a shallow wick retrace tripped the tight **0.35**
  BE trigger and stopped it at entry. These are self-inflicted.
- **False breakout (reversal day)** — ~50/68 closed the *opposite* way (`opp_eod > 0`). The
  breakout was simply wrong; BE correctly saved you. The right play is the **reversal trade**,
  which the system already takes and which rescued **13** of these days to net-positive.

Blanket "hold to EOD" is a trap: across all 68 it sums to **−$258/unit** (the reversal days
dominate). RVOL and time-of-day filters didn't help (they cut good trades too).

## 3. The fix — loosen the BE trigger

The 0.35 trigger (move stop to entry after only a 35%-of-OR retrace) fires too early. Raising
it lets the trade breathe. Swept over 2024→2026 (546 trades) **and** validated train/holdout:

| BE trigger | Net 24-25 (train) | Net 2026 (holdout) | 2026 WR | 2026 BE-stops | 2026 worst day |
|-----------:|------------------:|-------------------:|--------:|--------------:|---------------:|
| **0.35** (current) | +$602.63 | +$450.01 | 51.6% | 68 | −$1.25 |
| **0.50** | +$664.13 | +$460.19 | 53.8% | 59 | −$4.48 |
| **0.55** | **+$687.25** | **+$466.70** | **55.2%** | **56** | −$4.58 |

Both periods agree — higher trigger → fewer BE-stops, higher win rate, more net. The cost is a
larger worst day (−$4.58 vs −$1.25) because a deeper retrace occasionally becomes a small real
base-SL loss instead of a scratch. That is the honest trade-off, and it is still tiny next to
the ~$7 already risked per trade.

**Adopted:** **BE trigger 0.55** is now the default in `config/config.yaml`. The exact Pine
port (0.35) is preserved in `config/faithful_be035.yaml` for reproduction:

```
python cli.py backtest --start 2026-01-01 --end 2026-07-08                     # default (tuned)
python cli.py --config config/faithful_be035.yaml backtest --start ... --end ... # exact Pine port
```

## 4. Better alternative-trade capture — BUILT & ADOPTED

The false-breakout days close opposite 74% of the time, yet the default reversal (fresh
*buffered* close-break + fixed $5 TP + its own BE) only rescued a few. Two changes, gated by
`enhancements.reversal_capture`, fix that:

- **`trigger_on_be_stop`** — enter the reversal on a **raw** opposite OR break (earlier /
  more often) instead of waiting for a buffered break.
- **`trail_to_eod`** — the reversal rides the full move (no fixed $5 TP, no partial), exiting
  on BE-trail or EOD, so trend-reversal days are captured in full.

A/B over 2024→2026, train + holdout (default now BE 0.55):

| Reversal setting | Train net | Holdout net | Holdout rev P&L | Holdout worst |
|------------------|----------:|------------:|----------------:|--------------:|
| off (default reversal) | +687 | +467 | +140 | −4.6 |
| trigger_on_be_stop | +709 | +495 | +168 | −3.2 |
| **trigger + trail_to_eod (adopted)** | **+733** | **+502** | **+176** | **−3.2** |

Both changes clear the train/holdout bar, so they are **adopted as defaults** in
`config/config.yaml`. `target_or_mult` (OR-scaled reversal TP) was tested and left OFF — it
did not beat trail_to_eod.

### Combined effect of both adopted changes (YTD 2026)
| | Faithful port (BE 0.35) | Adopted (BE 0.55 + reversal capture) |
|--|------------------------:|-------------------------------------:|
| Net P&L | +$450.01 | **+$501.91** (+11.5%) |
| Win rate | 51.6% | **55.1%** |
| BE-Stop failures | 68 | **55** |
| Best day | +$27.86 | **+$33.84** |
| Worst day | −$1.25 | −$3.22 |

Reproduce the exact Pine port (no tuning) with `config/faithful_be035.yaml`.

## 5. Can the 7 failures be avoided? — tested, mostly no

Drilling into a single month (June 2026, 7 failures) with `scripts/inspect_day.py`:
- **3 of 7 are already winning days** — the reversal rescued them (Jun 10 +$17, 18 +$5, 24 +$3).
- **2 are unwinnable chop** (Jun 15, 25) — entered on the open, snapped back to breakeven, then
  ranged sideways; never broke the far OR boundary. BE caps them at ~$0.
- **1 is a whipsaw** (Jun 17) — the short was directionally right (close 394 vs 398.55 entry) but
  BE-stopped on a mid-day spike; the reversal long then bought the top. Net −$0.06.

Total cost of all 7 ≈ **−$0.14**. Crucially, **the failures and the biggest winners share the
same 09:35 opening-break setup** (Jun 5 +$20 and Jun 29 +$19 both entered 09:35, as did four
failures). You cannot filter the losers without killing the winners — which is why every
time-of-day / RVOL filter *reduced* net. BE protection is already optimal here.

**What was tested (train + holdout):**
| Lever | Result | Decision |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Bigger partial (25→75%) | BE-stops happen *before* any partial → count unchanged; helped train, hurt holdout | wash |
| **Wider TP `adaptive_tp_scale` 1.25** | +net on BOTH (train +$34, holdout +$9); lower WR | **adopted** |
| **Whipsaw re-entry** (`reenter_after_whipsaw`) | train +$38 (48% WR) but holdout only +$4.3 over 6mo (30% WR), +failures | built, **left OFF** (opt-in) |

The honest takeaway: the losers are already ~$0, so there is nothing to squeeze there — the only
robust lever is letting **winners run further** (TP scale), which trades win-rate for total P&L.

### 6-month 2026 with all adopted tunings (BE 0.55 + reversal capture + tp_scale 1.25)
157 trades · 52.9% WR · **net +$510.47** · best day +$33.84 · worst −$3.22 (vs faithful port
+$450.01). Re-entry stays OFF.

## 6. PDH/PDL confirmation filter — tested, left OFF

Hypothesis (desk observation): failures are immediate reversals off prior-day high/low
(PDH/PDL). Fix: when PDH/PDL sits within `proximity_pct` of the OR width of the break level,
require a close BEYOND PDH (longs) / PDL (shorts) before entering. Built as
`enhancements.pdh_pdl_filter` (default OFF).

**Validation (June 2026 failures):** partly true but not actionable.
- The *turn points* of 2–3 of 8 failures were right at PDH/PDL — Jun 15 short bounced $0.44
  above PDH, Jun 25 short $1.81 above PDL, Jun 16 long stalled $2.58 below PDH.
- But the *entries* were far from PDH/PDL (the break levels sat $5–21 away, i.e. 1–5× the OR
  width). Price only reaches PDH/PDL deep into the trade, not at entry — so an entry-proximity
  filter cannot see it.
- The other 5 failures reversed nowhere near PDH/PDL.

**Sweep (train + holdout, proximity 10–30%):** the filter barely activates on TSLA (OR breakout
levels are rarely near prior-day extremes) and does not help — holdout net 510.5 → 508.9 (10–14%)
and worse at wider bands. No setting improved results.

**Verdict:** the observation is real on a minority of days, but this specific rule doesn't
trigger enough on TSLA to matter and can't catch these failures (the entry isn't near PDH/PDL).
Kept as an opt-in (default OFF) — prior-day levels are meaningful S/R generally and may help on
other instruments/regimes. Not adopted.

## 7. Better TP process: runner peak-trail — ADOPTED

Diagnosing the *exit* side (6-month, per-unit): the winners reach a big peak but capture little.

| Exit | n | Realized/unit | Peak (MFE)/unit | Give-back |
|------|---:|-------------:|----------------:|----------:|
| EOD | 72 | $5.49 | $8.90 | **$3.41** |
| VWAP Cross | 18 | $2.41 | $8.94 | **$6.53** |
| BE Stop | 58 | $0.00 | $2.67 | (correct — reversed hard, EOD would be −$4.86) |

Root cause: the BE-trail only engages **after** price retraces to the BE trigger. On strong trend
days price never retraces that far, so the post-partial runner has **no trailing stop at all** — it
holds to EOD (or a VWAP cross), giving back the whole fade from the peak (~$540/unit total left).

Fix (`enhancements.runner_trail`): after the 25% partial, trail the 75% runner `or_mult × OR width`
below its running peak, engaging immediately. Swept train + holdout:

| Trail width | Train net | Holdout net |
|------------:|----------:|------------:|
| baseline (VWAP/EOD) | +$767 | +$510.5 |
| 0.75×OR | +$784 | +$490 (worse) |
| **1.0×OR (adopted)** | **+$795** | **+$522.6** |
| 1.25×OR | +$781 | +$516 |

1.0×OR adds +$28 train / +$12 holdout, lifts win rate and avg win, worst day unchanged. Tighter
trails overfit (help train, hurt holdout — shaken out of volatile trends). **Adopted @ 1.0×OR.**

### 6-month 2026 with ALL adopted tunings (BE 0.55 + reversal capture + tp_scale 1.25 + runner_trail 1.0×OR)
157 trades · 53.5% WR · **net +$522.56** (vs faithful port +$450.01, +16%). EOD exits 72 → 66 as
the runner banks its peak earlier. *(NOTE: this is the OPTIMISTIC fill-at-stop model — see §8.)*

## 8. Execution realism — BE stops fill at the bar CLOSE (alerts-only)

Desk observation: in live trading a BE stop loses ~$2, not $0, because the alert fires on the
5-minute **bar close** — there is no resting order, so you exit *after* the close, at the close.
`execution.exit_on_close: true` (now the default in `config.yaml`) models this: BE Stop / BE Trail
/ Base SL / runner-trail exits trigger on a close beyond the level and fill at that close.

**Impact (6-month 2026), optimistic (fill-at-stop) vs realistic (fill-at-close):**
| | Optimistic | Realistic |
|--|-----------:|----------:|
| Net P&L | +$522.56 | **+$214.03** |
| Win rate | 53.5% | 47.8% |
| Avg loss | −$0.21 | **−$3.87** |
| Worst day | −$3.22 | **−$22.06** |
| Profit factor | 34.7 | **1.67** |

June 2026: +$131.66 → **+$89.88** (PF 2.68, worst −$14.38).

The strategy is still profitable realistically, but far more modest, and the earlier "failures are
≈free" conclusion only held under the optimistic model. **Key execution lever:** placing a resting
stop order at the BE level (broker OCO) instead of a manual close-alert exit recovers most of the
gap and caps the tail — that is now the single highest-value improvement, and it lives in *how you
execute*, not in the signal. All prior tunings were validated under the optimistic model and should
be re-checked under `exit_on_close` if you trade purely on close alerts.

## 9. Re-tune under realistic fills + tail control (a + b)

**(a) Re-tuned under `exit_on_close` (train + holdout):**
- BE OFF *loses* money on train (−$33) — BE is essential under realistic fills.
- `adaptive_tp_scale` 1.25 → **1.0** (wider TP rides more trades into a real BE loss; 1.0 wins both).
- `runner_trail` 1.0 → **0.75×OR** (wins both).
- BE trigger 0.55 kept. Net effect (holdout 6-month): +$214 → **+$241**, train +$64 → +$99.

**(b) Protective stop — TESTED, LEFT OFF.** A resting stop at the OR boundary does **not** cap the
tail: the realistic worst days are whipsaws on *wide-OR* days where the loss **closes within the OR
range** (above the boundary), so the boundary stop never fires (and can worsen a wick-and-recover
bar). Worst day unchanged (−22.1), train net slightly worse. Kept as an opt-in
(`execution.protective_stop`), default OFF.

**The real tail driver + fix.** The 4 worst days are all: wide OR (risk $12–17) → primary BE-stops
big → the **2× reversal** BE-stops big in the other direction → −$16 to −$22 day. Dropping the
reversal halves the tail but costs $91 on holdout (too valuable). **Capping OR width at $8** is the
fix — skips the widest whipsaw days:

| | Train net | Holdout net | Train worst | Holdout worst |
|--|----------:|------------:|------------:|--------------:|
| re-tuned baseline | +$99 | +$241 | −$24.3 | −$22.1 |
| **+ max OR ≤ $8 (adopted)** | **+$159** | +$238 | **−$17.3** | **−$16.5** |

Train net +61%, holdout flat, worst day better on both — same return, lower risk.

## 10. Reducing the worst day — reversal risk parity (ADOPTED)

Every one of the 8 worst days has the same shape: **primary BE-stops small, then the 2× reversal
BE-stops big.** Across those days: primary −$28.53 vs **reversal −$60.04 (68% of the damage)**.

Cause: the reversal enters *after* price crossed the whole opening range, so its stop (the
opposite OR boundary) is far away — and then it's doubled by the 2× size.

| | n | avg dollar risk |
|--|--:|----------------:|
| primary legs | 120 | $6.16 |
| **reversal legs** | 30 | **$10.03 (1.6× the primary)** |

The 2× share multiplier (from the ORB doc) was never risk-adjusted. Fix: `reversal_risk_cap`
(profile) scales the reversal qty so its dollar risk ≤ cap (`scale`), or declines it (`skip`).

- **`skip` rejected** — regime-dependent (train +$163 / holdout +$164, a $74 collapse).
- **`scale` is smooth and consistent** on both segments.

Return per $1 of worst-day risk (net / |worst day|) rises monotonically as the cap tightens — but
that degenerates toward "no reversal" at the extreme. The **principled stopping point is risk
parity with the primary (~$6)**, not the ratio maximum.

| Cap (scale) | Holdout net | Holdout worst | ratio | Train net | Train worst |
|------------:|------------:|--------------:|------:|----------:|------------:|
| off | +$238 | −$16.5 | 14.45 | +$159 | −$17.3 |
| **$6 (adopted)** | **+$196** | **−$9.7** | **20.28** | **+$134** | **−$11.9** |

Worst day −41% for −18% net. **Sized to a fixed worst-day budget, that's ~+40% more profit for
the same risk** (e.g. a $100/day tolerance: 6.07 units × $238 = $1,445 vs 10.33 units × $196 =
$2,027). Worst 5 days flatten from −16.5/−12.9/−11.5/−10.8/−10.5 to −9.7/−9.3/−9.1/−7.4/−7.1.

## 11. Daily loss circuit-breaker — TESTED, REJECTED

Idea: once the day's realised P&L ≤ −X, take no new entries (blocks the reversal on bad days).
Built as `execution.daily_loss_limit` (0 = off, default).

**The signal is inverted.** On the 6-month data, the primary's loss *before* the reversal was:
- days the reversal **WON**: mean **−$4.06**
- days the reversal **LOST**: mean **−$3.34**

A *bigger* primary loss predicts a *better* reversal — a large primary loss means price moved
decisively against the breakout, which is exactly the move the reversal rides. A breaker therefore
cuts the reversals you most want. At a −$5 breaker it blocks 4 reversals, **all 4 winners**, avoiding
$0 of losses.

Sweep (train + holdout), judged on net per $1 of worst-day risk:

| Breaker | Train net | Train ratio | Holdout net | Holdout ratio |
|--------:|----------:|------------:|------------:|--------------:|
| off | +$134 | 11.29 | **+$196** | **20.28** |
| −$3/day | +$155 | 18.17 | +$145 | 19.56 |
| −$4/day | +$127 | 14.93 | +$157 | 21.14 |
| −$8/day | +$127 | 11.13 | +$196 | 20.28 (never fires) |

Train prefers −$3; the holdout's ratio gets *worse* there. The holdout's best (−$4) buys a **+4%**
risk-adjusted gain for a **−20%** cut in net. And at "safe" levels (−$6 and wider) it never fires,
because after the risk-parity cap the primary loss rarely exceeds −$6. **Regime-dependent and
value-destroying — left OFF** (opt-in via `execution.daily_loss_limit`).

**Conclusion: −$9.68 is the right worst-day floor.** The reversal risk-parity cap (§10) was the
real fix; the breaker adds nothing on top of it.

## 12. Regime: this is a LOW-VOLATILITY breakout system (volatility gate ADOPTED)

Full-year data (after fixing a DB gap — 2025 only had ~60 days stored) showed the edge is heavily
regime-dependent:

| Year | Trades | Net | PF | Expectancy/trade |
|------|-------:|----:|---:|-----------------:|
| 2024 | 315 | +$33.89 | **1.07** | $0.11 |
| 2025 | 288 | +$85.79 | 1.16 | $0.30 |
| 2026 H1 | 150 | +$196.23 | 1.81 | $1.31 |

2026 earns **12× more per trade** than 2024. So what differs? Building daily features that use
ONLY pre-entry information (prior sessions + the 09:30 OR bar) and correlating with day P&L:

- The only strong correlates are **post-hoc**: `efficiency` (trend-day-ness, +0.43) and
  `day_range_pct` (+0.40). Both are known only at the close — useless as a filter.
- **Every pre-entry feature has |corr| ≤ 0.06** (OR/ATR, gap, prior trend, OR volume). Linearly,
  nothing predicts the day.

But the relationship is a **step function**, not linear. Prior-20-day realised volatility, by quintile:

| rvol20 quintile | days | mean day P&L |
|-----------------|-----:|-------------:|
| Q1 (lowest vol) | 113 | +0.891 |
| Q2 | 112 | +0.728 |
| Q3 | 112 | +0.753 |
| Q4 | 112 | +0.742 |
| **Q5 (highest vol)** | 112 | **−0.156** |

Q1–Q4 are uniformly profitable; **only the top vol quintile loses money.**

**Causal mechanism:** with close-based BE stops (§8), a high-volatility bar closes further past the
stop, so the BE-stop cost scales directly with volatility. High vol doesn't break the signal — it
inflates the cost of being wrong.

**The filter.** Skip the day when prior-20d realised daily vol > threshold. Threshold = 80th
percentile of **2024–25 only** (4.92%); 2026 is out-of-sample.

| Year | Before | After | Days skipped |
|------|-------:|------:|-------------:|
| 2024 | +$33.89 (PF 1.07) | **+$65.67 (PF 1.19)** | 64 |
| 2025 | +$85.79 (PF 1.16) | +$82.71 (PF 1.19) | 66 |
| **2026 (OOS)** | +$196.23 (PF 1.81) | **+$196.23 (PF 1.81)** | **8** |

2026 has almost **no** high-vol days — that is *why* it outperformed. The gate rescues the worst
year (+94% net, PF 1.07→1.19), costs $3 in 2025, and **cannot touch 2026**. Every year now clears
PF ≥ 1.19; the razor-thin 1.07 is gone. Adopted as `enhancements.volatility_regime`.

## 13. Resume re-entry — BUILT, TESTED, REJECTED

Motivated by **2026-07-09**: the primary long (398.01) was BE-stopped at 392.43 (−$5.60) by a
single dip, then price rallied all day to close at 406.55. The reversal (a *short*, triggered by a
close below the OR low 390.86) never armed — price never came within $2 of it. Correct, but the
day was left on the table. A "resume" rule — re-enter the SAME direction when price closes back
beyond the original break level — turns that day into **−$5.60 → +$1.48**.

Implemented as `enhancements.resume_reentry` (trigger buffered/raw, optional risk cap, and
`disarm_other` controlling whether it competes with the reversal or both stay armed).

**It only works in 2025.** Resume-leg P&L and win rate:

| Year | Resume legs | Resume P&L | Resume WR |
|------|------------:|-----------:|----------:|
| 2024 | 37 | **−$16.7** | 32% |
| 2025 | 40 | **+$83.7** | **62%** |
| 2026 | 22 | **−$16.8** | 36% |

**It also cannibalises the reversal** (they compete for the same slot). In 2024 the resume
preempted **+$46.5 of GOOD reversals** and returned −$16.7 — a −$63 swing:

| Year | Reversal off→on | Preempted reversals worth | Resume delivered | Net |
|------|-----------------|--------------------------:|-----------------:|----:|
| 2024 | 65 legs +$17.3 → 49 legs −$29.2 | **+$46.5** | −$16.7 | **−$63** |
| 2025 | 52 legs −$36.1 → 42 legs −$36.5 | +$0.4 | +$83.7 | +$83 |
| 2026 | 30 legs +$59.8 → 19 legs +$69.9 | −$10.1 | −$16.8 | −$7 |

Letting **both** stay armed (up to 3 legs/day) removes the cannibalisation but is worse still:

| Variant | Train net | Train worst | Holdout net | Holdout worst | Holdout ratio |
|---------|----------:|------------:|------------:|--------------:|--------------:|
| **baseline (off)** | +$148 | −$13.1 | **+$192.3** | **−$9.7** | **19.87** |
| resume, compete (2 legs) | +$169 | −$13.1 | +$185.6 | −$9.7 | 19.18 |
| resume, both armed (3 legs) | **+$219** | −$18.4 | +$171.1 | −$13.7 | 12.51 |

The most aggressive variant is **best on train and worst on holdout** — the classic overfit
signature. Baseline beats both on holdout net, PF *and* worst day.

**Why:** 2025 was a **shakeout regime** (its reversals lost −$36, so resuming was the better bet);
2024 and 2026 were **reversal regimes** (reversals made +$17 and +$60). These are opposite worlds,
and — as with the entry filters (§5, §6) — we cannot tell which one we are in *ex ante*. The
reversal is positive in 2 of 3 years, so it keeps the slot. **Default OFF.**

2026-07-09 is an anecdote, not a pattern.

## 14. Breakout buffer — swept, KEPT AT 10%

Prompted by a TradingView chart running a 14% buffer (long trigger 396.19 = 395.54 + 0.655 on a
4.68 OR). Swept 0-25% across all three years:

| Buffer | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 H1 | Train | Holdout | Sum |
|-------:|-----:|-----:|--------:|------:|--------:|----:|
| 0% | +49.2 | +84.8 | +162.2 | +134.0 | +162.2 | +296 |
| 5% | +61.9 | +93.0 | +173.6 | +154.8 | +173.6 | +328 |
| 8% | +55.9 | +83.0 | +193.3 | +138.9 | +193.3 | +332 |
| **10% (kept)** | **+65.7** | +82.7 | +192.3 | +148.4 | +192.3 | +341 |

| 14% | +59.8 | +90.0 | **+201.3** | +149.8 | **+201.3** | **+351** |
| 18% | +56.8 | +75.8 | +176.6 | +132.6 | +176.6 | +309 |
| 25% | +44.5 | +44.2 | +171.6 | +88.6 | +171.6 | +260 |

**The curve is noise, not signal.** Walk 2024: `49 → 62 → 56 → 66 → 52 → 60 → 57` — it jumps ~$10
between adjacent settings, with no smooth optimum. Anything 5–14% is statistically the same; only
the extremes hurt (0% takes false breaks, 25% arrives too late). **Worst day is identical (-13.1 /
-9.7) at every buffer** — this knob has zero risk effect.

14% posts the best sum (+$351) but its entire edge comes from **2026, the friendly low-vol regime**;
in 2024 (the weak year we size off) it is *worse* (+59.8 vs +65.7). Adopting it would be tuning to
the good regime for a $9 gain inside the noise band. **Kept at 10%.**

## 15. 2026-07-09 — the reversal was RIGHT not to fire

The primary LONG (398.01) was BE-stopped at 392.43 (-$5.60) by one dip; price then rallied all day
to close 406.55. It *looks* like a missed reversal. It is not — **the reversal is always the OPPOSITE
of the primary, so on this day it could only have been a SHORT**, needing a close below the raw OR
low (390.86). The lowest close after the stop was 392.98; it never came within $2.

Forcing a short at that best-possible price and applying the engine's exact rules:

```
FORCED reversal SHORT @392.98, stop 395.54 (OR high), risk-parity qty 2.00, BE trigger >=393.43
EXIT 10:25 @ close 394.52 (BE Stop) -> -1.56/unit x 2.00 = -$3.12
Day WITH reversal: -$8.72   |   Day AS TRADED: -$5.60   |   Gate SAVED +$3.12
```

The miss people see on 07-09 is a **resume** miss (re-entering LONG), not a reversal miss — and the
resume rule was tested and rejected in §13 (it pays +$7 here but costs -$63 in 2024).

## 16. Third-eye review: "ORB Adaptive TP Best Default v1.23"

An external Pine script built on the same UDB v12.4.3 lineage. Concepts triaged against our work:

| Concept | Verdict |
|---------|---------|
| PDH/PDL **Confluence Gate** (extend trigger to PDH/PDL when within 25% OR) | Already built as `pdh_pdl_filter`; barely triggers on TSLA, holdout worse (§6) |
| PDH/PDL as S/R generally (Ahead Block, Break+Retest, Sweep-Reclaim, Momentum Bypass) | 11 HTF levels tested: **47% failure rate in BOTH** "level in path" and "clear path" groups. No signal (§5) |
| VWAP-cross trail | Superseded by the runner peak-trail (§7) |
| **Max Cap Stop Distance** | **NEW — tested, REJECTED** (below) |
| **2-close acceptance** | **NEW — tested, REJECTED decisively** (below) |
| Block entries at/after EOD | Trivial; an EOD-bar entry costs only slippage |
| Sweep-Reclaim block | Largely redundant — we already require a *close* beyond the trigger, so a wick-sweep never enters |

### Max-cap stop (`sl_mode: "Candle High/Low + Max Cap"`) — REJECTED

Caps the OR-boundary stop at `fixed_sl` from entry. Implemented and available.

It *does* fix 2026-07-09: `-5.60 (BE Stop) -> -4.05 (Base SL)`. But across three years:

| Cap | 2024 net | 2025 net | 2026 net | Total |
|----:|---------:|---------:|---------:|------:|
| off (OR stop) | +65.7 | +82.7 | **+192.3** | 340.7 |
| $3 | +55.7 | +95.6 | +189.4 | 340.7 |
| $4 | +70.0 | +81.3 | +185.8 | 337.1 |
| $5 | +67.1 | **+100.1** | +185.3 | **352.5** |
| $6 | +66.2 | +82.7 | +193.1 | 342.0 |

**The surface is noise.** 2025 swings `+95.6 -> +81.3 -> +100.1 -> +82.7` across caps $3→$6 — a $19
jump between adjacent settings, non-monotone, no optimum. The best total ($5) comes from train
(+$18.8) while **hurting the holdout** (2026: 192.3 → 185.3). Train-helps/holdout-hurts again.

Mechanically the cap rarely binds: BE fires on almost any retrace (wick ≤ `be_level`) and moves the
stop *up* to entry, so the cap only matters on wide-OR days where price closes below the capped stop
before touching `be_level`. Those are exactly the days `max_or_width $8` already skips.

### 2-close acceptance (`enhancements.confirm_two_closes`) — REJECTED

Require the *previous* bar to also close beyond the trigger.

| | 2024 net | 2024 worst | 2025 net | 2026 net | 2026 worst |
|--|---------:|-----------:|---------:|---------:|-----------:|
| baseline | **+65.7** | **−9.7** | +82.7 | **+192.3** | **−9.7** |
| 2-close | +43.1 | −14.9 | +84.0 | +150.3 | −10.4 |

It delays the fill (worse entry price) and **worsens both net and worst day** in 2024 and 2026.
On 07-09 it enters at 396.28 instead of 398.01 — a "better" loss (−3.87) purely by entering later
into the same stop. That is not an edge, it is a smaller position in the same bad trade.

### The most valuable insight from v1.23

Its own changelog says: *"Reversal Trades default OFF because the 365-day sample improved with
reversal disabled."* **Our data agrees with the diagnosis and rejects the cure.** Their reversal is
the un-risk-adjusted 2× fixed-size version — the exact design we proved causes **68% of worst-day
damage** (§10). They removed the reversal; we **sized it to risk parity** and kept the edge
(reversal legs: +$17 in 2024, +$60 in 2026; deleting it costs $91 on the holdout).

Same symptom, two fixes. Theirs throws away a profitable leg; ours keeps it and fixes the sizing bug.

## 17. TradingView validation found a real bug: entries at/after the EOD cutoff

Strategy Tester exports (30 / 90 / 365 day, ending 2026-07-09, `Shares per unit = 100`):

| Window | TV ÷100 | Python | Diff |
|--------|--------:|-------:|-----:|
| 30d | +94.08 | +88.56 | +5.52 |
| 90d | +155.00 | +150.22 | +4.78 |
| **365d** | **+255.77** | +215.97 | **+39.80** |

The 30-day is a **structurally exact** match — TV's 39 rows = 26 trades + 13 partials; reversals 5,
Trail 11, EOD 6, BE-Stop 9; fractional risk-parity sizes (161/113/72/126/82 shares) all present.

The 365-day overshoot is a bug. TradingView will **not honour a `strategy.close()` issued on the
same bar as the entry**, so an entry on the **15:55** bar (past the 15:50 cutoff) rides overnight:

```
Entry L  2025-08-08 15:55 -> Exit 2025-08-11 15:50 "EOD flat"  +1044   (over a weekend)
Entry S  2026-01-02 15:55 -> Exit 2026-01-05 15:50 "EOD flat"  -1481
Entry S  2025-12-24 09:35 -> Exit 2025-12-26 15:50 "EOD flat"  (half day: no 15:50 bar exists)
```

**12** such trades plus a half-session carry ≈ **+$58/unit of artifact** — the entire 365-day gap.
It never appears in the 30/90-day windows because they contain no 15:55 entries.

**Fix (both engines):** block new entries at/after the EOD cutoff, and always flatten on the
session's **last bar** (half sessions close at 13:00 and never produce a 15:50 bar; previously the
Python engine silently *dropped* those open trades at the day rollover).

Impact on Python: 365d 291 -> 289 trades, +$215.97 -> **+$212.95**. 30d/90d unchanged.
Full years: 2024 +$65.75 (PF 1.19) · 2025 +$79.63 (PF 1.18) · 2026H1 +$192.37 (PF 1.78).

**Note on §16:** the external ORB A+R v1.23 script had `blockEntriesAtOrAfterEOD` and this review
dismissed it as *"trivial; ~zero impact."* That was wrong. In the Python engine it *is* ~zero
(the trade opens and closes on the same bar for −$0.02), but in Pine it is a correctness bug. The
concept was right; only our engine's tolerance for it hid the cost.

## 18. External review response — execution modality, time window, reversal

An external reviewer ranked six recommendations. Each was tested on full-year 2024 / 2025 / 2026.

**(1) Execution modality — CONFIRMED as the biggest lever; `stop_fill_mode` added.** Every loss is
a close-fill BE stop averaging ~$3.68/share *through* the stop — a tax on the alerts-only workflow,
not on the alpha. A broker resting stop fills at the stop ±slippage instead. Modelled honestly
(`stop_fill_mode: touch`, gap-aware fill at min(stop, open), which also wicks out trades that dip to
entry and recover):

| model | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 |
|-------|-----:|-----:|-----:|
| close-fill (alerts-only) | +65.8 (PF 1.2) | +79.6 (1.2) | +192.4 (1.8) |
| touch slip $0.03 | +155.4 (1.7) | +148.0 (1.5) | +246.7 (2.7) |
| touch slip $0.10 | +134.7 (1.6) | +130.8 (1.4) | +235.7 (2.6) |
| touch slip $0.20 | +105.0 (1.4) | +106.2 (1.3) | +220.1 (2.4) |
| stop-exactly (fantasy) | +377.8 (24.9) | +439.4 (27.8) | +383.7 (32.8) |

A resting stop roughly **doubles net** and lifts PF to 1.3-1.6 with a smaller worst day — but the
"PF 24" only appears if stops fill at exactly entry (zero gap slippage), which will not happen live.
The truth is measurable: paper-trade a resting stop on TradeStation and compare. Default stays
`close` (the honest alerts-only number); `touch` is one config line away.

**(3) Time window on primaries — VALIDATED, recommended.** Late ORB breaks (compressed choppy
mornings) underperform. Restricting entries to 09:35-11:00 (also gates midday reversals):

| variant | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 | ugly(24+25) | total |
|---------|-----:|-----:|-----:|------------:|------:|
| baseline | +65.8 | +79.6 | +192.4 | +145.4 | +337.7 |
| window 09:35-10:30 | +58.9 | +113.5 | +162.7 | +172.5 | +335.1 |
| **window 09:35-11:00** | **+74.2** | +92.6 | +179.6 | +166.8 | **+346.4** |

11:00 is PF-positive in all three years and net-positive in the weak 2024 (+$8, PF 1.19->1.26). The
exact cutoff is noisy (10:30 is *worse* than 11:00 in 2024), so this is a risk-shift — trade a little
2026 upside for weak-regime robustness — not a free lunch. It is `enhancements.time_window`, off by
default; enable `end: "11:00"` to adopt.

**(2) Reversal — reviewer's 365d view was pre-cap; full years disagree by regime.** With the $6
risk-parity cap already in place: deleting the reversal *helps 2025* (+$36, a shakeout year) but
*hurts 2024* (−$17) and *2026* (−$60). `reversal_qty_mult 1.0` is the robust middle (2024 +67.2,
2025 +88.5, 2026 +180.7 — better on both weak years, small cost in the strong one). Kept at 2×-capped
for now; the time window already removes the worst midday reversals.

**(4/5) Partial & trail — CONFIRMED as-is.** 15% partial marginally beats 25% in all three years but
by <$10/yr (noise). Tighter runner trail (0.55/0.65×OR) *badly hurts* 2025 (+$37/+$31 vs +$80) — the
0.75 trail is right. BE trail $0.25 has zero exits under close-fill but 9 under touch, so it is not
cosmetic if you move to a broker stop — kept.

**(6) Guardrails — agreed and already the house rule.** Every change above was judged on 2024/2025,
not on the flattering Jun-Jul 2026 stretch. The Mon/Fri seasonality the reviewer flagged as overfit
bait was not acted on.

## 19. Confirmation-candle trigger — TESTED, REJECTED (5th entry filter to fail the same way)

User request: instead of entering on the first close-break, require the NEXT candle to HOLD beyond
the trigger (and, optionally, be a with-trend candle); if it snaps back inside, wait for a fresh
break. Motivated by 2026-07-09 (10:00 break, 10:05 back inside; only the 11:35 break + 11:40 hold
was real). Implemented as `enhancements.confirm_breakout`.

**On July 2026 it looks great** — turns the 07-09 BE-stop (−$5.60) into +$4.46 and 07-06 into
+$10.77 (the failed opening short is replaced by a confirmed long). Month +$27.27 → +$34.78.

**On the full sample it loses:**

| variant | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 | ugly(24+25) | total | worst 2024 |
|---------|-----:|-----:|-----:|------------:|------:|-----------:|
| baseline (immediate) | +65.8 | +79.6 | +192.4 | +145.4 | +337.7 | −9.7 |
| confirm hold + trend | +42.8 | +112.3 | +125.1 | +155.1 | +280.2 | −14.9 |
| confirm hold only | +43.2 | +79.9 | +150.4 | +123.0 | +273.4 | −14.9 |

Helps 2025 (+$33, a shakeout year) but hurts 2024 (−$23) and 2026 (−$67); total −$57.5; and the
worst day gets *worse* (−9.7 → −14.9). **Why:** confirmation makes you enter later at a worse price
on the trend days (07-02: short filled 413.76 instead of 418.70, −$5 on a runner), and TSLA's
biggest winners are immediate follow-through breakouts. The whipsaw-saves are outnumbered by the
trend-fill-costs, and a confirmed entry that fails is more extended from the OR, so a bigger stop.

**Pattern (now 5 for 5): every entry-timing filter fails the same way** — time-of-day, RVOL,
PDH/PDL, 2-close acceptance, and now confirmation. On TSLA, filters that WAIT cost more on trends
than they save on whipsaws. The edge is in management (BE, risk-parity sizing, trailing), not entry
selection. Kept as an opt-in (default OFF); the immediate-entry logic stays final.

## 20. Higher-win-rate profile ADOPTED: 2-candle confirmation + Max-Cap $5 stop

User chose to prioritise win rate. The confirmation candle (§19) raises WR but enters later, which
widens the entry->stop distance and enlarges the worst day (2024 −9.7 → −14.9). Two fixes tested:

| fix on top of 2-candle | 3yr net | 3yr WR | 3yr exp | 2024 worst |
|------------------------|--------:|-------:|--------:|-----------:|
| none (2-candle only) | +280 | 50.3% | +0.47 | −14.9 |
| **+ Max-Cap $5 stop** | **+295** | 50.0% | **+0.50** | **−8.7** |
| + skip entry ext≤1.5×OR | +182 | 48.4% | +0.38 | −8.8 |
| + skip entry ext≤1.2×OR | +49 | 47.9% | +0.29 | −5.2 |

The **skip guard is wrong** — it discards the whole trade (tail *and* winner), so net collapses.
The **stop-cap is right** — it keeps the trade but caps the loss, so the −$14 tail becomes −$5
while winners survive. Adopted: `confirm_breakout` ON + `sl_mode: Candle High/Low + Max Cap`,
`fixed_sl 5.0`.

Standalone the Max-Cap was noise (§16); it earns its place ONLY paired with confirmation, whose
extended entries are exactly what it caps.

### New default vs the immediate-entry profile (full years, per unit)
| | Immediate (old) | 2-candle + cap $5 (new) |
|--|----------------:|------------------------:|
| 2024 | +$65.8 (WR 45.4, worst −9.7) | +$54.7 (WR **48.0**, worst **−8.7**) |
| 2025 | +$79.6 (47.5, −13.1) | +$124.0 (**52.5**, −12.3) |
| 2026 H1 | +$192.4 (51.3, −9.7) | +$116.6 (49.3, −10.4) |
| 30/90/365d net | 88.6 / 150.2 / 213.0 | 76.4 / 113.1 / 188.4 |
| 365d WR | 49.5% | **50.9%** |

The new default trades ~$14/yr of net and a little 2026 upside for a higher win rate and a smaller
worst day. Revert with `confirm_breakout.enabled: false` + `sl_mode: "Candle High/Low"`.

### TradingView Strategy Tester validation (2026-07-10)
Ran the updated Pine strategy on TSLA 5m for three windows; reconciled against the Python engine
on the identical date ranges:

| Window | From | TV ÷100 | Python | Net diff | Worst day |
|--------|------|--------:|-------:|---------:|----------:|
| 30d | 2026-06-10 | +61.96 | +61.26 | +0.70 | −8.29 (both) |
| 90d | 2026-04-13 | +114.92 | +117.31 | −2.39 | −10.42 (both) |
| 365d | 2025-07-10 | +176.62 | +188.38 | −11.76 | −12.25 (both) |

**Worst day matched to the cent in all three windows** → Max-Cap + confirmation are byte-for-byte
aligned. Trade count reconciles once TV's per-partial rows are collapsed (30d: 22 trades + 11
partials = 33 rows; 365d: 269 + 94 = 363). Max-Cap verified in fills (every Base SL ≈ −$5/share);
confirmation verified because 90d net (+114.92) tracks the 2-candle number, not the old immediate
+150. 30d net matches within slippage; the 365d −6% is the known feed-drift + vol-gate-day
classification divergence, not a logic bug (the cent-exact worst days rule that out).

## 21. 3-candle (and 4-candle) confirmation — TESTED, REJECTED
Generalised confirmation to `hold_bars` = prior consecutive same-day closes beyond the trigger
(1 = the adopted 2-candle rule). Tested 2/3/4-candle across 3 years, all else default (Max-Cap $5):

| Rule (hold_bars) | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 H1 | 3yr net | WR | exp |
|------------------|-----:|-----:|--------:|--------:|---:|----:|
| 2-candle (1, current) | +54.7 | **+124.0** | +116.6 | **+295.3** | 50.0% | **+0.50** |
| 3-candle (2) | +62.6 | **+46.8** | +114.4 | +223.7 | 50.7% | +0.40 |
| 4-candle (3) | +81.4 | +63.1 | +103.8 | +248.4 | 53.0% | +0.47 |

3-candle trades 24% of net (+295 -> +224) and 20% of expectancy for +0.7pt WR — and the loss is
almost all **2025** (+124 -> +47), the strong-trend year, because the 3rd hold bar enters after the
move's body. Non-monotonic (4-candle > 3-candle on net) = regime noise, not a stable edge. More
confirmation buys win rate at a steep cost in missed upside. KEPT 2-candle (hold_bars=1). The lever
stays as an opt-in `enhancements.confirm_breakout.hold_bars` (default 1 = no change).

## 22. System-improvement study — execution, sizing, generalization (2026-07-11)

Three levers tested after entry-filtering was exhausted (edge is in management, not entry).

**(1) Resting stop — REAL WIN, recommended.** Compared the three fill models across 3 years:
| fill model | 3yr net | WR | worst day | worst trade |
|-----------|--------:|---:|----------:|------------:|
| close (current, alerts-only) | +295.3 | 50.0% | −12.3 | −9.03 |
| **touch (realistic OCO, gap-aware)** | **+348.7** | 49.5% | **−7.8** | **−5.02** |
| stop (fill exactly @ stop, 0 slip) | +801.7 | 50.5% | −6.1 | −5.02 |
A real broker resting stop (touch model) is **+18% net AND ~halves the worst day** (−12.3→−7.8)
and worst trade (−9.03→−5.02). The +801 "stop" figure is the zero-slippage fantasy (the ~$450 gap
to touch = gap-through-stop cost). Adopting = moving from alerts-only to placing OCO stops.

**ADOPTED 2026-07-11.** `stop_fill_mode: close → touch`. New default full years (Run #56): 2024
229tr/47.6%/+95.67/PF1.41/worst-7.76 · 2025 221tr/51.1%/+119.02/PF1.38/worst-7.77 · 2026H1
140tr/50.0%/+134.04/PF1.73/worst-6.24 · combined 590tr/49.5%/+348.72/PF1.48/worst-7.77. Benchmarks:
30d +76.80/PF5.15/-5.04 · 90d +114.82/PF2.29/-6.11 · 365d +193.80/PF1.54/-7.60. BOTH Pine scripts
rewritten to native resting stops (strategy: two labelled `strategy.exit(stop=)` orders SL/TR so the
reversal arms only on SL; indicator: `exitOnClose` default OFF + gap-aware fill). Residual Pine-vs-
engine gap: a resting order moves only after a bar completes, so TV applies a newly-armed BE stop one
bar later than the engine (bar that arms BE *and* stops → TV fills base SL, Python ~entry; TV more
conservative). Needs TradingView re-validation via the CSV loop.

**(2) Vol-normalized sizing — REDUNDANT on TSLA.** Sizing each primary to a constant $5 risk vs
flat 1 unit: net +295→+297, worst day unchanged. The Max-Cap $5 already bounds per-trade risk, so
sizing only nudges the few sub-$5-stop trades. No benefit single-symbol. (Code reverted; its real
use is ATR-scaling levels for multi-symbol — see below.)

**(3) Multi-symbol generalization — EDGE IS TSLA-SPECIFIC at these settings.** Ran the default
engine on 7 liquid names, 2024-01→2026-07 (avgR = pnl/risk is price-neutral):
| sym | WR% | avgR | | sym | WR% | avgR |
|-----|----:|-----:|-|-----|----:|-----:|
| **TSLA** | **50.0** | **+0.10** | | NVDA | 43.2 | −0.00 |
| AMD | 47.8 | +0.02 | | GOOGL | 44.5 | +0.02 |
| MSFT | 46.0 | +0.01 | | META | 47.5 | −0.04 |
| AMZN | 46.7 | +0.01 | | (NFLX bad FMP data, excluded) |
TSLA's +0.10 avgR is 5x the best other name; everything else is ~0 with sub-50% WR. **The edge does
not generalize.** CAVEAT: dollar params (Max-Cap $5, TP floor $2.14, OR-gate $8) are TSLA-price-
scaled — $5 is 0.8% on META ($631, punishingly tight) vs 2.5% on NVDA ($203). So "no edge" is
confounded with "levels mis-scaled." The clean re-test = express Max-Cap/TP/OR-gate as %/×ATR, then
re-run the basket. Until then: KEEP single-symbol TSLA; do not deploy on other names.

## 23. Liquidity sweeps / stop-fill slippage — slippage bumped 0.02 -> 0.10 (conservative)

A resting stop becomes a MARKET order when triggered, so it can fill WORSE than the level (a "sweep"
wicks through the stops and reverses). The 5m backtest fills AT the level and CANNOT see sub-bar
sweep wicks (no tick/1m data on this FMP plan), so the touch model is optimistic on stop fills.
Every trade's main leg exits via a stop/market fill (only the 25% TP partial is a protected limit),
so slippage hits nearly the whole book. Stress (extra $/share on all stop/market exits, on top of base):

| extra $/sh | 3yr net | worst day |
|-----------:|--------:|----------:|
| 0.00 | +348.7 | -7.8 |
| 0.10 | +289.8 | -7.9 |
| 0.25 | +201.4 | -8.2 |
| 0.50 | +54.1  | -8.7 |
| 1.00 | -240.6 | -9.7 |

~$59/unit per $0.10/share; edge survives to ~$0.50, breaks even ~$0.60. TSLA is very liquid so real
avg slip is likely $0.05-0.15, not $0.50 — but the $0.02 default was too light for stop fills.
ADOPTED `slippage_per_unit 0.10` as the conservative working baseline. New default (Run #57):
2024 +74.51/PF1.30 | 2025 +100.60/PF1.31 | 2026H1 +122.49/PF1.65 | combined 590tr/49.2%/+297.60/
PF1.39/worst-7.91. Benchmarks 30/90/365: +74.98(PF4.92)/+108.99(PF2.18)/+171.42(PF1.46). The one
number the backtest CANNOT give is your true stop-slip — paper-trading must MEASURE it. stop-market
= guaranteed exit + slip; stop-limit = no slip but risks not filling (bigger loss). Use stop-market.

## 24. Re-tune under the resting stop — confirmation DROPPED ("Config A" adopted as default)

Ablating the current default (all at touch + $0.10) showed features tuned under CLOSE-FILL are now
suboptimal — the resting stop caps whipsaws at $5, so "avoid-whipsaw" filters lost their benefit but
kept their cost:

| variant (touch+0.10) | 3yr net | PF | worst |
|----------------------|--------:|---:|------:|
| CURRENT (confirm ON) | +298 | 1.39 | -7.9 |
| **Config A: confirm OFF** | **+469** | **1.65** | -8.9 |
| Config B: confirm+runner OFF | +574 | 1.79 | -8.9 |
| (net-max but strips risk control) no-max-cap | +352 | 1.48 | **-13.7** |

**ADOPTED Config A** (confirm OFF, keep runner-trail + ALL risk controls). Better every year:
2024 251tr/45.0%/+137.9/PF1.58 | 2025 236tr/47.0%/+103.7/PF1.32 | 2026H1 151tr/53.6%/+227.8/PF2.46 |
combined 638tr/47.8%/+469.4/PF1.65/worst-8.85/143rev. Benchmarks 30/90/365: 27tr/+79.27/PF3.93 |
78tr/+160.79/PF3.01 | 290tr/+278.95/PF1.81. Trade-off: WR 49->48% (-2pt) for +57% net. Config A =
`config.yaml` default now; Config B saved as `config/tsla_best_B.yaml`. NOTE: net-max ablations that
strip risk controls (max-cap, vol gate) were NOT chosen — they add net but remove tail protection
(no-max-cap worst -13.7). Re-enable confirmation ONLY if reverting to close-fill.

## 25. OR-midpoint stop (LuxAlgo "moderate 1:1.5") — TESTED, REJECTED

Idea (LuxAlgo ORB page + user): stop at the OR MIDPOINT — cancel the breakout if price pulls back
through the middle of the opening range. Added sl_mode "OR Midpoint" / "OR Midpoint + Max Cap".
Tested vs Config A (all at touch + $0.10):

| stop mode | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 | 3yr | avg risk |
|-----------|-----:|-----:|-----:|----:|---------:|
| Max-Cap $5 (Config A) | +138 | +104 | +228 | **+469** | $4.5 |
| OR Midpoint | +125 | +101 | +210 | +436 | $3.7 |
| OR Midpoint + Max-Cap | +129 | +100 | +211 | +440 | $3.6 |
| OR boundary (no cap) | +135 | +131 | +236 | +501 | $5.4 |

Midpoint is WORSE in ALL 3 years (+436 vs +469). The tighter stop (avg $3.7 vs $4.5) causes
premature exits: the OR midpoint acts as an early-session CHOP MAGNET (the page even calls it a
"magnet"), so price routinely dips through it before the real move, stopping us out. The resting
stop already caps losses cleanly at the boundary/cap, so a tighter invalidation costs more in lost
runners than it saves. KEPT as an opt-in sl_mode; NOT adopted.

Bonus finding: OR boundary with NO cap = +501 (> Config A +469) under the resting stop — but it
raises per-trade risk (avg $5.4, worst ~$8.8) for marginal net; KEPT the Max-Cap for tail safety
(same "don't strip a risk control for net" rule as §24). Other LuxAlgo techniques were already
present or already rejected: candle-close entry (have), RVOL/volume filter (built, off — entry
filters all fail), trend/gap alignment (§ pre-market: real but unexploitable), runner-trail (have),
vol gate (have, but ours skips HIGH vol — a low-vol system), EOD/time exit (have).

## 26. ATR-scaled stop cap — TESTED, IMPROVES TSLA + unlocks multi-symbol

The fixed dollar params were fitted to TSLA ~$400. But TSLA's ATR(14) ranged **4.6x** over 2024-2026
($6.2 -> $28.8), so the fixed $5 stop silently meant **0.24x to 0.80x ATR** at different times (tight
in high-vol 2025, loose in calm 2024). Added sl_mode "Candle High/Low + ATR Cap" (cap = atr_mult*ATR,
ATR shifted = no lookahead). Test vs fixed $5 (Config A, TSLA):

| stop cap | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 | 3yr | avg risk |
|----------|-----:|-----:|-----:|----:|---------:|
| Fixed $5 (current) | +138 | +104 | +228 | +469 | $3.7->$4.9 |
| ATR 0.35x | +137 | +108 | +232 | +477 | $3.3->$5.3 |
| ATR 0.40x | +136 | +107 | +236 | **+479** | $3.5->$5.6 |
| ATR 0.50x | +135 | +107 | +236 | +478 | $3.8->$5.8 |

ATR cap is +~2% net (+469 -> +479), modestly better (neutral 2024, small gains 2025/2026). Plateau
0.35-0.50x (robust, not a fit peak); mechanism sound (constant vol-normalized risk); worst day
~unchanged; avgRisk now ADAPTS ($3.5 calm -> $5.6 volatile). (NOTE: an earlier run showed +503/+7%
but that was a NaN-fallback BUG — the first ~14 days had no ATR and ran UNCAPPED; fixed, clean = +479.)
So on TSLA-alone the win is small. The REAL prize is MULTI-SYMBOL (§22): with ATR-scaled levels the
fixed dollar params (max-cap/TP-floor/OR-gate) stop being TSLA-price-specific, so the edge can scale
across symbols. Kept as opt-in sl_mode; the decisive next test = ATR-normalize ALL fixed levels + re-run
the basket. (OR-based TP already adapts — OR/ATR ~0.31 stable — only the FIXED params need scaling.)

## 27. Full ATR-normalization sweep — the OR-GATE is the winner, not the stop

Extended ATR-scaling to ALL fixed-$ params via `atr_normalize` enh (per-param stop/gate/rev toggles +
mults), isolating each (Config A, TSLA):

| ATR-normalized | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 | 3yr | worst |
|----------------|-----:|-----:|-----:|----:|------:|
| Baseline (fixed $) | +138 | +104 | +228 | +469 | -8.8 |
| stop only 0.40x | +138 | +103 | +228 | +468 | -8.5 |
| **gate only 0.55x** | +121 | **+139** | +223 | **+483** | -8.8 |
| reversal only 0.40x | +138 | +104 | +229 | +471 | -10.1 |
| all (0.40/0.55/0.40) | +118 | +141 | +222 | +481 | -9.4 |

**The OR-WIDTH GATE is the fixed param that benefits from ATR (+3%, +469->+483), all from high-vol
2025 (+104->+139).** The fixed $8 gate got too tight as TSLA's ATR grew (skipping wide-OR days that
were only "wide" in dollars, not in vol) — ATR-scaling the gate lets those good 2025 days back in, with
the SAME worst day (-8.8). The STOP is neutral (§26) and REVERSAL is neutral-with-worse-tail (-10.1).
Aggressive multi-param tunes hit +503 (0.35/0.50/0.35) to +535 (looser) but worsen the worst day (-9 to
-11) and are overfit-prone — NOT chosen. Clean takeaway: **ATR-normalize the OR-gate** (single-param,
mechanistically clear, robust); leave stop/reversal fixed. `atr_normalize` kept opt-in (default off).
Still the key to MULTI-SYMBOL (§22).

### TP1 fill model — touch/cross vs close-through (touch KEPT)
Prompted by 2026-07-08: the short's TP1 sat at 390.53; FMP's 14:55 low was 390.51 (clipped it by
2¢) so Python took the partial (+$1.59), but TradingView's feed printed the low ~2¢ higher and
missed → rode to EOD (−$1.03). Pure feed divergence — the trigger logic is already touch-based and
identical in both scripts (`low<=tp` / `high>=tp`). Tested the only stricter alternative (TP1
counts only if the bar CLOSES beyond the target):

| Mode | 3yr TP1 fills | WR | 3yr net |
|------|--------------:|---:|--------:|
| **touch/cross (current)** | **204** | **50.0%** | **+295.35** |
| close-through | 187 | 48.2% | +273.69 |

Touch is both more lenient AND strictly better (+17 fills, +1.8pt WR, +$21.66/unit). KEPT.
No code change — touch is already production. Chasing the 2¢ TV miss would require a fill
tolerance that would manufacture phantom partials elsewhere. Judge marginal fills in aggregate.

### Final realistic 6-month 2026 (all adopted, exit_on_close)
BE 0.55 · reversal capture · tp_scale 1.0 · runner_trail 0.75×OR · max_or_width $8:
**150 trades · 50.7% WR · net +$238.06 · PF 1.87 · worst −$16.47** (vs the un-re-tuned realistic
+$214 / PF 1.67 / −$22.06). Reproduce optimistic Pine numbers with `config/faithful_be035.yaml`.
